# chessv_skymate
Modifications for Greg Strongs ChessV 2.2 engine to empower it to play strict 10x10 Chess (Skymate)

Source code and compiled dll including the necessary modifications.

Use:

- Replace the original ChessV.Games.dll with the one provided by this repository after you installed ChessV 2.2 from chessv.org.

- Open C:\Program Files\ChessV2\Graphics\Piece Sets\Standard, copy/paste a piece icon you like and rename it to Eagle.bmp

- After starting the program you can select Skymate from the index tab.

That's all. In case you are interested in the modified source code files, you'll find them in the source folder.
